# ProiectOOP2 (Curierat Rapid)

A tiny project made for university purposes with OOP's basics.

# Overview

This project summarizes a delivery firm by entering some car details like capacity, speed and positions and then reads some coordinates of package with height and weight and then finds the nearest or the best car for delivering this package.

`ProiectOOP2.cpp` is the main part of the program and contains the user interface and the interactive menu from which you can choose to add a car, to enter the coordinates of a order and so on.

`JoKerException.hpp` is an inherited exception class for my custom exceptions.
The others .cpp and .h are the class used in the program.
